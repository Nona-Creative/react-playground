React Playground :: Contributing
===

Master branch is reserved for ideal skeleton project, so to contribute new features to the ideal skeleton project, submit a pull request to master branch.

Alternatively you can create a new feature or implement some additional tech on a separate branch.

You can also add yourself as a code owner to any branches you create, add protection to it, and then invite others to contribute to it.
